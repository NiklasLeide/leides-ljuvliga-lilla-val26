## WSL2 / Environment

### WSL2: permission errors on /mnt/c/
**Symptom:** Permission errors running scripts or tools on files under `/mnt/c/`.
**Cause:** Windows filesystem mounted at `/mnt/c/` doesn't support Linux permissions.
**Solution:** Keep the project on the native WSL filesystem (`~/projects/`). Only use `/mnt/c/` for dropping files from Windows.

### git init fails or behaves unexpectedly
**Symptom:** `git init` or git operations fail on `/mnt/c/`.
**Cause:** Same filesystem permission issue as above.
**Solution:** Keep the git repo on native WSL: `~/projects/leides-ljuvliga-lilla-val26`.

### Python venv fails
**Symptom:** `python -m venv` fails or venv doesn't work.
**Cause:** Symlinks and permissions broken on mounted Windows filesystem.
**Solution:** Create venv on native WSL: `python3 -m venv ~/venv-leides-ljuvliga-lilla-val26`

## Claude Code

### Claude Code auto-update fails on startup
**Symptom:** Warning on startup that Claude Code failed to auto-update.
**Cause:** Global npm packages need sudo; auto-updater doesn't use it.
**Solution:** `sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
Not critical — Claude Code still works, it's just a warning.

### Claude Code forgets to update PROJECT_STATUS.md
**Symptom:** Tasks get done but PROJECT_STATUS.md stays stale.
**Cause:** Prompt-based rules in CLAUDE.md get missed when Claude is focused on code.
**Solution:** Don't rely on prompts — enforce with tooling. Use a `commit.sh` script
or git hooks that check documentation is updated before pushing.
**General principle:** If something needs to happen every time, automate it. Never rely on Claude remembering.

## Git / GitHub

### npm global install needs sudo
**Symptom:** `npm install -g` fails with permission errors.
